Switched to draw.io for diagramming as it seems to be better than yEd.

Due to wanting a processor that can run compiled MIPS I code, I'm going to model my processor off what I learned in class and the R2000 processor that ran MIPS I.

Quartus Lite 18 running on Linux Ubuntu, the same system as the MIPS cross compiler.

Continued taking notes on Verilog/SystemVerilog.

Created a yEd project to map out the entire computer as a giant hierarchy of block diagrams.
